/**
 * This class is used by the client to send out a heartbeat, which tells the server that the client is active
 * and should not be disconnected. It extends the TimerTask class, meaning that it can be executed as a task by the
 * Timer class to execute at fixed intervals. To accomplish this, it takes the clients socket as a parameter and
 * uses an object of type 'PrintWriter' to output via the sockets outputStream.
