CURRENT:

- No currently known bugs.

SOLVED:

- When entering an occupied username, the user gets stuck in a loop prompting for another username, even when entering a valid one.
- When a client is terminated w/o a QUIT message the related socket's keepAlive will keep resetting to 'true' after each iteration, rendering the heartbeat useless.
- Clients QUIT message is broadcasted to all clients.
- The Timers are out of sync, even with the same period as parameter resulting in active clients getting disconnected.
- Current extraction of username may contain incorrect characters depending on host machines IP address.
- Server is sending its list of active usernames to every client after each check on active connections, even though the list hasen't changed.
- Receiver will throw nullPointer when quit message is sent from client to server.
- Username will sometimes be accepted, even with incorrect input.
